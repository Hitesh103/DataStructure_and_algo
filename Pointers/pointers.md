# Pointers

As we know 1 byte = 8 bits and every byte has their own address we can access them by that 

But to store the address we use the data types called Pointers

Pointers are syntaxed with star (*) star shows it's pointer..
like int *a; so here a is the pointer.

We will read *a as value at a means it's address  

*a showa the value at a means a is address

Double Pointers stores the address of pointer
