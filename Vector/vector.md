# C++ Vector Class

This is a simple implementation of the vector class in C++. The vector class is a dynamic array that can be resized during runtime, making it very useful for managing arrays of unknown size. This implementation includes all the basic operations that you would expect from a vector class, as well as some more advanced operations.

## Getting Started

To use this implementation of the vector class in your own code, simply include the vector header file in your source code:

```c++
#include <vector>
```

## Creating a Vector

To create a vector, you can simply instantiate a new object of the vector class:

```c++
vector<int> myVector;
```
This creates a new vector object named myVector that can hold integers.

## Adding Elements to a Vector
To add elements to a vector, you can use the push_back method:

```c++
myVector.push_back(10);
```

This adds the integer 10 to the end of the myVector vector.

## Accessing Elements of a Vector
You can access elements of a vector using the [] operator:

```c++
int x = myVector[0];
```

This retrieves the first element of the myVector vector and stores it in the integer x.

## Finding the Size of a Vector
You can find the size of a vector using the size method:

```c++
int size = myVector.size();
```

This retrieves the number of elements in the myVector vector and stores it in the integer size.

## Removing Elements from a Vector
You can remove elements from a vector using the pop_back method:

```c++
myVector.pop_back();
```

This removes the last element from the myVector vector.

## Resizing a Vector
You can resize a vector using the resize method:

```c++
myVector.resize(10);
```

This resizes the myVector vector to hold 10 elements. If the new size is larger than the current size, the new elements will be initialized to their default value (for integers, this is 0).

## Inserting Elements at a Specific Position
To insert an element at a specific position in a vector, you can use the insert method:

```c++
myVector.insert(myVector.begin() + 2, 5);
```

This inserts the integer 5 at the third position of the myVector vector.

## Erasing Elements at a Specific Position
To erase an element at a specific position in a vector, you can use the erase method:

```c++
myVector.erase(myVector.begin() + 2);
```

This removes the element at the third position of the myVector vector.

##Clearing a Vector
You can clear a vector using the clear method:

```c++
myVector.clear();
```

This removes all the elements from the myVector vector.

## Sorting a Vector
You can sort a vector using the sort method:

```c++
sort(myVector.begin(), myVector.end());
```

This sorts the myVector vector in ascending order.

## Conclusion
That's it! With this implementation of the vector class, you should be able to manage arrays of any size with ease. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact me.
